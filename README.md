# EIBoris

Explainable and Interpretable Boris is an extension of the original BorisCAD and aims to introduce more explainability concepts at the neural network level.
The original BorisCAD version is released as V1.0.0.

# TODO

### Main Branch

- [ ] Change metrics to Pytorch Ignite
- [ ] Update config.yaml parsing to support missing arguments (e.g. training without segmentation or resuming previous saved training)
- [ ] Train memory in X images as part of the training process

### EIBoris Branch

- [ ] Integrate IcCNN into the current model
- [ ] Understand how to manage the training process from and to these filters
- [ ] Remove all the bloat their features have, keeping it to the minimum
- [ ] Figure out how to extract the filters and display them

Changes to the TODO list are made in the _main_ branch whenever it is pushed.
